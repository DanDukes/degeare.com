          <p>
            I am a Full Stack Web Development Student with a strong background
            in Web Application Security and Team Management, educated at the
            University of California, Los Angeles and currently earning a
            certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of Utah.
            Newly honed skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript and
            backend/database development. Strengths lie in project/people
            management, creativity, and problem solving. Have developed internal
            security tools, policies, and training courses. Opened, staffed,
            trained, and general managed multi-million dollar businesses, and am
            recently developing several public facing web applications both solo
            and with a small team. Excited by challenging problems, and
            passionate about approaching solutions from differing viewpoints.
            Security and management experience combined with strong technical
            web development skills position myself well to manage fast-paced and
            deadline-driven creative development teams.
